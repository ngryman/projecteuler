# Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Code

```javascript
console.time('solved in');

const MAX = 4e6;

var sum = 2,
	f1 = 1,
	f2 = 2,
	term = 3;

while (true) {
	f1 = f2;
	f2 = term;
	term = f1 + f2;

	if (term >= MAX) break;
	if (0 === term % 2) sum += term;
}

console.log('answer:', sum);
console.timeEnd('solved in');
```

## Result

```bash
answer: 4613732
solved in: 1ms
```
