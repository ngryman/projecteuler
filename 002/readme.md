# Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Code

```javascript
console.time('solved in');

function resolve(max) {
	for (
		var f1 = 1, f2 = 2, sum = 2, term = 3;
		term < max;
	    f1 = f2, f2 = term, term = f1 + f2
	) {
		if (0 === term % 2) sum += term;
	}
	return sum;
}

console.log('answer:', resolve(4e6));
console.timeEnd('solved in');
```

## Result

```bash
answer: 4613732
solved in: 1ms
```
