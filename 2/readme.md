# Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Code

```javascript
console.time('solved in');

var sum = 0;

for (var i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
	if (0 === i % 3 || 0 === i % 5) {
		sum += i;
	}
}

console.log('answer:', sum);
console.timeEnd('solved in');
```
